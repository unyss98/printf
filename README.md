# Project Name: Custom Printf Function

### Project Description

This is a collaborative project on creating a custom printf function In C that mirrors the functionality of the 'printf' function in the standard library. Our function prints the '%' character and supports the following specifiers:
- %s
- %c
- %d
- %i
- %u

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- 'main.h': This contains the function prototype with include guards to prevent multiple definitions of the prototype.
- 'printf.c': This contains the implementation of our custom 'printf' function.
- 'README.md': This file contains the overview documentation of the repository,explaining the components of the project and its use.

## Usage

To use this 'printf' function, simply include the 'main.h' header file in your source code and call the 'printf' function with the desired format string and arguments.
